### Before you push a commmit

- Make sure that all the code is commented and legible variable names are used. Do not have any unnecessary overheads or redundant code.

### When to create a new Branch

A new branch is to be created for new feature with an appropriate name. For example, when adding the video-conferencing feature, one should create a new branch from the main branch named graphicalperceptionlv-customtheme (There is no set naming nomenclature that one has to follow. Just use legible branch name)
